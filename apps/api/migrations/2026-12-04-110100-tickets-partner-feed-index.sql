-- @no-transaction
-- Keyset index for the partner tickets feed (see 2026-12-04-110000). Built
-- CONCURRENTLY so a busy tickets table is never write-locked during the
-- build. IF NOT EXISTS keeps re-application a no-op. An interrupted
-- CONCURRENTLY build leaves an INVALID index that IF NOT EXISTS would
-- silently accept, so the DO block fails loudly in that state (same pattern
-- as 2026-10-30-130100-partner-api-alerts-feed-index.sql).
-- Recovery: DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY public.idx_tickets_partner_feed_xid, then
-- let autoMigrate re-run this file.

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_tickets_partner_feed_xid
  ON public.tickets (partner_feed_xid, id);
