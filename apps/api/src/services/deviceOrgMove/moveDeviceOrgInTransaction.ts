  // that device_id column) can reach them. Every alert-facing reader pins
  // these rows to the ALERT's org — hideAiNoiseCondition /
  // correlationMetadataCondition (routes/alerts/alerts.ts) and
  // latestVerdictsForAlerts / latestVerdictForGroup
  // (services/aiAgents/alertVerdicts.ts) — so a row left behind is
  // invisible to the org that now owns the alert: the moved alert
  // silently loses its AI-noise suppression and its correlation badge,
  // and nothing regenerates either (the verdict scheduler is event-driven
  // off `alert.triggered` and never re-scans).
  //
  // ORDER — group -> member -> verdict. Two reasons, and the FIRST is a
  // lock order, not a data dependency:
  //
  //  1. LOCK ORDER (#5005 review). The other writer of this pair is the
  //     correlation job (services/alertCorrelationGroups.ts), which
  //     upserts the GROUP and then its MEMBERS, in that order, on every
  //     pass. Taking them the other way round here is a textbook AB-BA:
  //     a correlation pass running concurrently over the same group
  //     deadlocks with this move and Postgres kills one with 40P01,
  //     surfacing as a 500 on an admin action. Same class of bug and same
  //     fix as the ticket-child order in
  //     services/ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts (#4657) — read that module for
  //     the precedent. This pair is not listed there because its
  //     counterpart is the correlation job rather than a second org-mover,
  //     but the rule is identical: state the order once, and align with
  //     the existing writer instead of reasoning locally.
  //  2. DATA DEPENDENCY, and it runs the same way. The member statement
  //     reads `alert_correlation_groups.org_id` as re-stamped by the group
  //     statement, and the verdict's group leg reads that same column.
  //     NOTHING reads `alert_correlation_members.org_id`: the group's
  //     "does this group still span two orgs?" guard reads `alerts.org_id`
  //     (re-stamped by the generic loop above), never the member row's own
  //     org. An earlier revision of this comment asserted the opposite —
  //     that member -> group -> verdict was load-bearing — and the order
  //     it justified was the deadlock in 1.
  //
  // Placement of the whole block is load-bearing too: AFTER the generic
  // loop, because the group guard reads alerts.org_id as re-stamped by it;
  // and AFTER the ticket chain above, so this extends — never reorders —
  // ticketOrgMoveLockOrder.ts's documented order. None of the three
  // carries a composite tenant FK, so there is no 23503 hazard of the kind
  // the ticket chain is ordered for.
  //
  // A GROUP travels only once EVERY member alert shares the target org —
  // handing a group to an org that owns part of it would make its
  // member_count / noise_reduction_percent claims wrong for both orgs. A
  // group still spanning two orgs is left behind and counted below.
  //
  // The third guard is `alert_correlation_groups_org_key_uq (org_id,
  // group_key)`: the correlation job mints group_key as
  // `root:<rootAlertId>` PER ORG (services/alertCorrelationGroups.ts), so
  // the target org can already hold the same key — reachable precisely
  // because this gap let a previously-moved alert grow a second group
  // there. Skipping is deliberate: derived correlation state must not be
  // able to fail an admin's device move with a 23505, and merging two
  // groups (which one's status/score/metadata wins?) is not this route's
  // call to make silently.
